        <h1>Viduthalai Part 1</h1>
        <p>
          "Viduthalai Part 1" follows the journey of Kumaresan, a newly
          recruited police constable who is assigned to assist a special task
          force operating in a remote, forested area. The task force is on a
          mission to capture "Perumal" alias Vaathiyar, the leader of a
          revolutionary group called "People's Army," which fights against the
          state's oppression of tribal villagers. As Kumaresan witnesses the
          brutality and human rights violations committed by the police in the
          name of national security, he begins to question his role in the
          system. He also develops a relationship with a village girl named
          Tamilarasi, which deepens his emotional connection to the villagers.
          The story explores themes of state violence, personal morality, and
          freedom, highlighting the stark contrast between the oppressed and
          those in power. The film ends on a tense note as Kumaresan slowly
          realizes the truth behind the government's actions and begins to
          sympathize with the rebels, setting the stage for the sequel.

      <h1>Pottu</h1>
        "Pottu" is a horror-thriller film directed by Vadivudaiyan. The story
        revolves around a medical college student named Bharath, who becomes
        possessed by the spirit of a transgender woman named Pottu. Initially,
        Bharath is a normal student, but after a series of supernatural events,
        his behavior changes drastically. The spirit of Pottu seeks revenge
        against those who wronged her in the past, especially targeting a
        corrupt and cruel doctor who once exploited her. As the story unfolds,
        we learn about Pottu’s painful backstory, how she faced injustice due to
        her identity, and how her soul now uses Bharath as a medium to expose
        and destroy the evildoers. The film mixes horror, social issues, and
        revenge with dramatic twists, ending with the message of justice for the
        marginalized.
